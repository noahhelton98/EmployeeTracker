# EmployeeTracker

## Description 
A command line tool that allows you to keep track of employees, roles, and departments within your company. You can view, remove and add employees, roles, and departments. Also, you are able to update any employee's role. Some special functionality allows you to view employees by department.

## Development
This tool was generated using node.js, the inquirer module, and mysql module. Furthermore, it contains seeds and schema sql files so you can set up your database using MySQL workbench.


## Instructions
First you will need to run an npm install to install all of the dependencies. Next, you will need to create your database in MySQL workbench, to do this, copy and paste the schema and seed file(if you want to test it out, however if you want to start your company tracker from scratch feel free to skip copying the schema.sql file) in the MySQL Workbench. Change working directories (cd) into whichever directory contains the Tracker.js module and run the command node Tracker.js
